You may ask why gatsby? not React? or Next? or basic HTML/CSS? Well\n        answer is very simple, Gatsby enables developers to build fast, secure,\n        and powerful websites using a React-based framework and innovative data\n        layer that makes integrating different content, APIs, and services into\n        one web experience incredibly simple.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        site is developed such a way that it is able to render normal MarkDown\n        files (MD) and also the file related to CMS (here I've taken use of\n        contentful), right now only one type of file can be rendered i.e.\n        contenful file.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        In the course of time, I'll try to give this site more functionality,\n        for now it is just basic project for me to understand gatsby.\n      </p>\n      <h4>Thanks</h4>\n    </Layout>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default IndexPage\n","// extracted by mini-css-extract-plugin\nexport var link = \"contact-module--link--27Q8g\";"],"sourceRoot":""}
